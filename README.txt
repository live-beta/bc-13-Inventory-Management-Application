Inventory Management System

Inventory system that has items with the following character
id name, description,total amount available cost per item date added status (can be one of true r false  depending on whether the item has been cjecked out or not. )

for a live demo presentation of the project
there needs to be a user maybe a point of sale terminal that allows
the real time tracking of the items that have been sold and those that are still in the inventory

there should be an admin that should be able to follow or track the information that has been generated or edited
